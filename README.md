## Ello iOS App

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ello/ello-ios.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ello/ello-ios)

### Open source, but not open API

Our API requires an application key and secret, which are currently being kept private.  You can browse the source, and
you can compile it, but you won't be able to run it against our API.  Sorry, but we don't have the resources to support
this kind of open access.  We have always planned to offer 3rd party access, so hopefully this will change soon!


### Environment Variables

We use the `dotenv` gem to access application secrets in the terminal, and `cocoapods-keys` to store them in the app.
Add the following values to your `.env`.

- `ELLO_STAFF`: set this in your bash/zsh startup script to access private cocoapods (you must have access to the private repos).
- `GITHUB_API_TOKEN`: used for generating release notes during distribution
- `INVITE_FRIENDS_SALT`: used for generating the salt for sending emails to the API
- `CRASHLYTICS_KEY`: used for sending data to Fabric
- `PROD_CLIENT_KEY`: the key or id used for oauth
- `PROD_CLIENT_SECRET`: the secret used for oauth
- `PROD_DOMAIN`: the domain for the API to hit
- `NINJA_CLIENT_KEY`: the key or id used for oauth
- `NINJA_CLIENT_SECRET`: the secret used for oauth
- `NINJA_DOMAIN`: the domain for the API to hit
- `STAGE1_CLIENT_KEY`: the key or id used for oauth
- `STAGE1_CLIENT_SECRET`: the secret used for oauth
- `STAGE1_DOMAIN`: the domain for the API to hit
- `STAGE2_CLIENT_KEY`: the key or id used for oauth
- `STAGE2_CLIENT_SECRET`: the secret used for oauth
- `STAGE2_DOMAIN`: the domain for the API to hit
- `STAGING_SEGMENT_KEY`: used for sending data to segment

### Setup

Once you have client credentials, compile them into cocoapods-keys by running:

- `rake generate:keys`


### Other

- List available rake tasks: `bundle exec rake -T`


### Testing out Push Notifications with Knuff

- Download Knuff https://github.com/KnuffApp/Knuff/releases
- Install `ElloDevPushSandbox.p12` in your keychain (talk to [@steam](https://github.com/steam) to get it)
- Print out your device's APNS Token in the function `updateToken()` in `PushNotificationController`
- Build to device in `Debug` mode
- Code Signing Identity: `iPhone Distribution: Ello PBC (ABC12345)`
- Provisioning Profile `iOSTeam Provisioning Profile: co.ello.ElloDev`


### Universal Links

Starting with iOS 9 Apple added support for [Universal Links](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/AppSearch/UniversalLinks.html). The previous link does a good job explaining the concept. Generating the `apple-app-site-association` file that is needed on the server is not well explained.

`aasa.json`

```json
{
    "applinks": {
        "apps": [],
        "details": [
            {
                "appID": "ABC12345.co.ello.ElloDev",
                "paths": [ "*" ]
            },
            {
                "appID": "ABC12345.co.ello.ElloStage",
                "paths": [ "*" ]
            },
            {
                "appID": "ABC12345.co.ello.Ello",
                "paths": [ "/native_redirect/*" ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

`STAR_ello_co.key`, `STAR_ello_co.crt` and `STAR_ello_co.pem` are in the Ello Ops 1Password vault

```bash
cat aasa.json | openssl smime \
 -sign \
 -inkey STAR_ello_co.key \
 -signer STAR_ello_co.crt \
 -certfile STAR_ello_co.pem \
 -noattr \
 -nodetach \
 -outform DER > apple-app-site-association
```

### APNS certificates

See also <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/mobile-push-apns.html>

Create the certs in Apple's developer portal in the usual way (using the
1Password APNS password as the cert keyphrase), and download the `.cer` file
(two of them, actually, one for `co.ello.Ello`, one for `co.ello.ElloDev`).
Install that file into your keychain, then export the private key (in`.p12`
format).


### Pinning certificates
We use pinned certificates to avoid man-in-the-middle SSL attacks.  We use a rolling "primary + backup" pair of certificates, so if the primary expires or needs to be pulled, the backup is easy to swap in.  Every now and then the primary / backup need to be rotated.

### Cutting a new release
Merge all new changes into master, checkout a new branch `release/x.x.x`. Change version number in `Ello` and `Share Extension` targets. Create the archive using the `Ello` scheme (not `ElloDev`). Using `Ello` will update the build numbers in both plists. Commit version and build number changes. Upload archive to TestFlight. After QA changes are often required. Continue making changes, merging them into master. Then rebase the release branch onto master and repeate until a release candidate is submitted to Apple for review. Once the release is approved and live in the store you `git tag x.x.x` and merge the release branch into master. Following these conventions will allow github to automatically mark the release as an official release.

Sometimes you may need to increase the build number without making any changes to the code. iTunesConnect requires unique build numbers which in our case, are based off the number of commits. Any easy way to do that is `git commit --allow-empty -m "bumping build number"`.
